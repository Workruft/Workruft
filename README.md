## Can I help?

Yes.

## How 2 Server? How 2 Develop?

1. Depending on which you're wanting to do:
    - Server:
      - Put the following in the same local folder (if not the entire project):
        - /Server/
        - /Common/
        - package.json
    - Development:
      - Clone the entire repository to your computer. (Btw might wanna [lern](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide)
        u some [git](https://git-scm.com).)

Then:
  1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Once you can type `npm -v` in your terminal and see the version
     printout, you should be good to go.
  2. With a terminal open at the local Workruft directory, type `npm install` to have Node automatically install
     Workruft's dependencies. Wait for it to finish.
  3. Depending on whether you're using Visual Studio Code:
      - VSCode:
        - Run the NPM script `start-server` from the sidebar.
      - Not VSCode:
        - Run `node 'Server/index.js'` in the terminal.

If running the server:
  - You should now see this in the terminal:
    > Server ready and listening! {"address":"::","family":"IPv6","port":1337}<br/>
    > Gettin yo IP...<br/>
    > Yo IP address is: 1.2.3.4

    Once you do, the server is up!

If developing:
  - Contact Mr. Workruft himself and ask how you can be of help with your miserable lack of skillz.
